# Instagram Tutorials Repository

Welcome to the Instagram Tutorials repository! This monorepo contains a collection of mini projects that I teach through my Instagram posts and reels. Each project is designed to help you learn and master different concepts using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and TurboRepo.

## About TurboRepo

TurboRepo is a tool for managing monorepos. It simplifies the development process by allowing you to work with multiple packages within a single repository. With TurboRepo, you can easily manage dependencies, share code between projects, and streamline your workflow.
