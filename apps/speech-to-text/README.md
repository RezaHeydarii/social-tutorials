# Speech to Text Project

Welcome to the Speech to Text project! This mini-project is part of the Instagram Tutorials repository, where we explore the usage of the Web Speech API in React applications. In this project, you'll learn how to create a custom hook to utilize the Web Speech API for converting speech to text. Additionally, we'll integrate this hook into an input field and detect colors in the spoken text.

## Scripts

To run this project locally, you can use the following scripts:

- `yarn dev`: This script runs the project in development mode.
- `yarn build`: Use this script to build the project for production usage.
- `yarn preview`: Preview the built version of the web app.

To get started with the Speech to Text project, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`.
2. Run the project using `yarn dev`.
3. Open your browser and navigate to the specified localhost URL to see the project in action.

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can interact with the input field to speak and see the converted text. The hook will detect colors in the spoken text and display them accordingly. Experiment with different phrases and colors to explore the functionality further.
